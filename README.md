Product List Application

Project Description

The Product List Application is a web-based tool designed to efficiently manage and display a list of products. It incorporates fundamental JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, closures, and encapsulation to ensure an interactive and user-friendly experience. The application provides features like product searching, filtering, data mapping, and total price calculation.
